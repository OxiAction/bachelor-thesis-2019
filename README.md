## Bachelor Thesis - Univ. Salzburg - Computer Science - 2019
I used my previously developed 2D Engine [FSM](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine) and extended it with two additional core parts:
1. AI development using Hierarchical Finite State Machine:
- Prototype in Java: [FSM](https://github.com/OxiAction/fsm)
- Implementation: [Lucid-Engine FSM](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine/tree/master/src/engine/components/fsm)
2. Pathfinding using A-Star algorithm
- Implementation: [Lucid-Engine Pathfinding](https://github.com/OxiAction/Lucid-Engine/blob/master/src/engine/misc/Pathfinding.js)
